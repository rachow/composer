# The Installer

# Installer project is a tiny project with a bunch of objects that remove tedious tasks that a modern
# developer has to deal with.

# Now a days the modern developer has to maintain and install many packages and yet this can be time 
# consuming since you have to understand the commands and rules of installation for each of the package

# What we have here is a simple step installer, which will literally install any package that is supported
# feel free to use and modify and re-distribute as necessary to fit your needs!
#

# Usage: drop files into the correct directory then run the following script
# php install.php --help


# Enjoy!
